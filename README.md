# Protein-Abundance-Database

WIP: Protein Abundance Database

## Note:

The repository is a work in progress repository. There is at the moment no database that can be used in PK-Sim. This repository should be the place to gather information, feedback as well a central place to discuss on the topic.

## Goals

- repository for working on a new database of protein abundances. PK-Sim would greatly benefit from such a database, enabling IVIVE and inter-species extrapolation.
- Discuss scientific and technical aspects of such a database

See discussion in forum [here](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Forum/issues/239).
